####REQUIRES FFMPEG AND PYTHON 2.7

The script requires ffmpeg installed on your system and defined in your PATH or ffmpeg.exe in the directory of the image.

Double click the script in Windows or run `python2 ./makeanim.py` on a Unix based system(Linux/OSX)

Don't come to threads saying that the script prompts you for an input even after you dragged a file to it, it no longer works as such. Adding it back may not be possible.

Big thanks to Zes in the thread for dropping tips on how to improve this!
