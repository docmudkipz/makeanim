"# makeanim"

The script requires ffmpeg installed on your system and defined in your PATH or ffmpeg.exe in the directory of the image.

If you for what ever reason dont know how to use the .sh on linux or mac the command is "sh makeanim.sh" in a terminal
without the quotes. Your image should be in the same directory.

*nix users, make sure there is only 1 period in the file separating the filename from the extension. I.e. thing.mp4 or 
it will return an error

Windows users, drag and drop your flie onto the .bat file or double click it.
